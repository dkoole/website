Welcome to my homepage. I'm active on the amateur bands since 2014.

Former callsign: PD2DK (September 2014 - April 2015)  
Current Callsign: PA2DK (Since April 2015)  
Locator: JO21IX

Mainly active on shortwave and 50mhz. Main interests are Contesting, DXing, /P activities and Building stuff.  

Main mode of operation is CW. Don't talk about it, just do it!

QSL via: Buro, Direct, LOTW  
I prefer paper QSL cards. At the moment (summer 2023) i do not have them in stock. Will send them later. I will only send a QSL card for the first contact or for new DXCC/BAND/Mode points. All QSO's are also uploaded to LOTW.

Hope to hear you on the air!

73, Dennis PA2DK
